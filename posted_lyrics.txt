I've been lying to the liars
Take me as I am<newline>I'm tired of dancin' around the point<newline>Sharp and it is jagged<newline>Like the shape of glass and it steals my voice
Can you let me be intoxicated on my own?
I've been getting old standin' by the river, watch the water move but I don't move with her
From this place I'm runnin' from, I know I can't escape
I'm grateful for you
Don't take me for what I'm sayin', just take me for what I am<newline>'Cause this is where I'm stayin', my two feet are in the sand
Please give me one more day of happiness. I need it, I need it
Tonight we can go it alone
'Cause it's always raining and the clouds are always grey when you're away
Can you tell me just one thing? Can you give me a reason to stay?<newline>'Cause the feelings I'm harborin' don't seem to see the light of day
I don't like you very much but I keep putting up with your shit
Feedin' families, forget the fame, I'm doing it now for a second name
Know when something's wrong, but somethin' inside tells me it's all okay. Even if it's strange, it's our love
